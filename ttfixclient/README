# Instructions

Building QuickFix:
------------------

First install openssl from https://www.openssl.org/
to /usr/local

Download quickfix-1.15.1 from GitHub.

If you want to disable file system I/O in QF please
read README in qf_hack.

Then build QuickFix:

        ./bootstrap
        ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local
        make -j8
        make check
        sudo make install

Building TT FIX Client:
-----------------------

Make sure that your include path contains the QuickFix configuration
file config.h. It will normally be found in: quickfix-1.15.1/
In main.cpp it is used to assert if QuickFix was build with SSL support.

Once you have installed QuickFix run the Python script cleanqf.py
to convert C++11 headers to C++17. If you are planning to use C++11
or C++14 this step is not necessary.

Code was built using GCC 8.5.0

Assuming you have installed QuickFix in /usr/local you can use this command to build:

g++ -I../../quickfix-1.15.1 -std=c++11 TTFixClient.cpp main.cpp -o test -lquickfix
or 
g++ -I../../quickfix-1.15.1 -std=c++17 TTFixClient.cpp main.cpp -o test -lquickfix

where -I../../quickfix-1.15.1 points to location of config.h

QuickFix settings:
------------------

Settings for QuickFix are found in a file called "settings". In particular,
code assumes that sequece numbers are reset as in the settings file.
